This game is based on Scorched Earth for PC computers.
This game is turn based. Try to aim with your tank to the enemies and shoot 
them before they kill you.

It's not fully finished, there should be the weapon shop, weapon selection and
shields. You can just shoot with your default weapon. Computer players aims and
shoots. There can be up to 8 players, including humans and computers. Players
can create teams and work together against other teams. Just assign all players
to the teams.

This game was made for my Siemens SL45i mobile phone. It was created for the
resolution common in these phones and the screen was monochromatic (2 colors).

To run this game you need a mobile phone with Java J2ME support or any
J2ME emulator for any computer. I have tried it with the KEmulator 1.0.3 for 
Windows 10 and it works fine. You can find it in the internet for free, i.e. 
here: https://archive.org/details/KEmulator103

If you use the KEmulator, this is the easiest way:
1) Run KEmulator
2) Open Midlet menu and select the "Load jar" option
3) Open Tankz.jar file
4) The game should start immediately
5) You may need to open a keypad window to start the game: use the View menu
and select the "Keypad" option.

Now you can play it. It is possible that the resolution for the game will be
wrong. You can try to change some options in the Tool or View>Options menu.
