RX-800b is a similar game to the Boulder Dash with additional elements. There
are a few level missions. You can collect items or must destroy some bombs or
monsters.

There are 19 levels in this game, but the game itself isn't fully finished.
But current version is playable.

You'll find two different versions in the archive file. The first one has
monochromatic graphics for older phones with one-color LCD screen. The oher
one has colorful graphics for newer phone models. There is no difference
in the gameplay between those two versions.

This game was made for my Siemens SL45i mobile phone. It was created for the
resolution common in these phones and the screen was monochromatic (2 colors).

To run this game you need a mobile phone with Java J2ME support or any
J2ME emulator for any computer. I have tried it with the KEmulator 1.0.3 for 
Windows 10 and it works fine. You can find it in the internet for free, i.e. 
here: https://archive.org/details/KEmulator103

If you use the KEmulator, this is the easiest way:
1) Run KEmulator
2) Open Midlet menu and select the "Load jar" option
3) Open RX-800b black white version.jar or RX-800b color version.jar
4) The game should start immediately
5) You may need to open a keypad window to start the game: use the View menu
and select the "Keypad" option.

Now you can play it. It is possible that the resolution for the game will be
wrong. You can try to change some options in the Tool or View>Options menu.

Recommended KEmulator settings:
Device type: Siemens C65
Screen width: 101px
Screen height: 100px
